# Bluetooth Low Energy Fundamentals Course Exercises
This repository is part of the [Bluetooth Low Energy Fundamentals](https://academy.nordicsemi.com/courses/bluetooth-low-energy-fundamentals/) course by [Nordic Developer Academy](https://academy.nordicsemi.com).

The Bluetooth Low Energy Fundamentals course is an online, self-paced course that focuses on teaching the basics of Bluetooth LE using Nordic Semiconductor devices (nRF52 and nRF53 Series).

Through hands-on learning, participants will learn how to create a Bluetooth LE prototype and establish a wireless, unidirectional and bidirectional data channel between two Bluetooth-LE-enabled devices in a short period of time.
Upon completion of the course, participants will have a thorough understanding of the Bluetooth LE protocol and its layers, as well as knowledge of available APIs in the nRF Connect SDK, which is based on the Zephyr RTOS.

Additionally, participants will have gained practical experience in configuring Bluetooth LE advertisements and connections, as well as insight into securing Bluetooth LE connections and inspecting packets over the air using nRF Sniffer.
