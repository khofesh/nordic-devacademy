- [scheduling algorithm](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/zephyr/kernel/services/scheduling/index.html#scheduling-algorithm)

> Zephyr RTOS is by default a tickless RTOS. A tickless RTOS is completely event-driven,
> which means that instead of having periodic timer interrupts to wake up the scheduler,
> it is woken based on events known as rescheduling points.
